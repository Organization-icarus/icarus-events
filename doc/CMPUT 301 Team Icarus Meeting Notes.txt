### Project Part 2 Discussion

Created Kanban project in repository

#### 1.

All user stories go into the product backlog, create issue for each user story (there are 44, one issue per story)
Format: UserId, Description, story points, risk factor

story points = how much work a user story will require (assign based on Fibonacci sequence)

Greek number = risk factor (how risky implementing the feature will be/how many bugs it may introduce)

Look at story board sequence example

Start designing UI for the app (based on user stories)

Story board sequence outlines how the app is traversed. FIGMA (recommended)

#### 3.
